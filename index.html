                    <p>My name is David, I am 19 years old and I am in the second period of Analysis and Systems Development <br />
                        My high school was with a technical course. <br />
                        I graduated in Aquaculture at E.E.E.P Professor Gustavo Augusto Lima.

                    <H2>A little more</H2>
                    <p>I like to read, listen to music and play <br />
                        And my favorite colors are black, white and gray. <br />
                        I really like programming web pages, watching their development makes me happy

                    <H2>how did I start programming?</H2>
                    <p>
                        since I was very young I had access to computers, but that was never a reason to really want to program. 
                        I only used them for games. Only after a friend introduced me to the programming did I stop to think about how everything on the computer worked. 
                        I grew up and after my first contact with a programming language (C#) being a programmer became my main option for the future.
